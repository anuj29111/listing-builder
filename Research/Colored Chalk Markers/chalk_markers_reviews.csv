"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2022",joshua o.,yes,yes,Artist wife loves these,"My wife is an artist and uses these for street signs she makes for those who passed by to enjoy. She loves these chalk markers, if it isn't obvious from the amount of chalk boards she's used them on since purchasing these about 2 weeks ago. She had used other chalk markers in the past but absolutely hated them because they would leak down standing board which is how she has to draw large scale boards standing straight up, so it's important that the product she uses does not drain down into any work she has already put into the chalk board sign. Loddie Doddie Chalk markers do not seem to have many issues doing this, it did happen once with a neon color she used, but easily wiped up right away without causing issues to anything around it. She told me only 2 out of this pack had one explosion after shaking but probably the reasoning was more a user error considering they had sat in sun while she chalked on the beach.There are photos of how 3 different types of chalks look on a board, her reasoning for this is to show the difference in how they spread and visibility to others from a distance.  These markers are bold, bright, and definitely much more visible from a distance than the pastel chalks she uses to create the illustrations on board.As far as the erasing thing, okay so it will take some work, but don't all things worth while? First, understand your board must be seasoned,  which means if you have a brand new chalkboard use chalk and dust it up. I know its not new pretty anymore,but clean up is easier and staining is less likely. Use water and a rag, a little dawn soap doesn't hurt, if you are still having issues throw some white side walk chalk over the top and try the water again.My wife gives these two thumbs up and will be coming back for more!",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oM+piWr2L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g1+nhc8EL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81F5r28SK7L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GSKgfZAfL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81I0sMs0pbL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LJL3pkJ1L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XbiINFNSL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mGI1kudaL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qdPEm5j8L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ryZ1ItT6L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81s2yLAuc5L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sDzTeKqML.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uuMmjhZtL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9132h30nHpL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Hob3q8qxL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MJ4MMW7F40US/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B08JW3NM26,Size: 1 Count (Pack of 24)
"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2019",Cathy,yes,yes,Please Ignore the Number 1 Star Reviews,"I was boarding 5 dogs.  I decided to get this cheap dry erase board at Five Below store that was black and came with a white marker to record who did number 1, 2, or both and the time.  It also said you could use fluorescent colors on the black, dry erase board.  They were also cheap, but thought I'd give them a try.  They hardly showed up.  The white one that came with the $5 board didn't work at all.  I purchased these, of course from Amazon.  I took the first one out of the box.  I was so excited to try it because the fluorescent purple (that was the easiest to see, hardly showed up).  I tried my first white one from Loddie Doddie.  It didn't work.  I was so, so bummed.  I thought ""maybe they got too frozen"" on the porch delivery and let them sit for a few hours in the house.  We shook it-there's a little bead inside.  It didn't work.  I was bummed again.  Then I thought that the first one just might be a ""dud"".  I took out the second one.  I shook it.  Nope, didn't work.  I basically thought, ""This sucks!""  THEN, I read the directions (3 very simple steps) on the back of the box.  Hold it up vertically-yeah.  Shake it-I had already.  THIRD step direction, clearly written on the back of the box: Press tip for a few seconds until tip fills with ink.  Recap after each use..............I used my finger and pushed the tip for a second figuring yeah, yeah.  I tested a line on the black dry erase board and man, that white, bright ink came out slick as could be.  I was already set up for defeat, and then thought, Son of a ********.  They work beautifully.  I'm so glad I uh, ""read the directions"", which I always get on my husband for not doing-which I hadn't either.  I mean, who would have thought you needed to read directions for a marker?  I LOVE them.  I tried so hard to upload from my phone to the computer so that you could see the fluorescent compared to what I can see at a glance now.  PLEASE ignore the 1 star comments about none of them working.  They work beautifully and show up brightly if you follow direction step #3.  I feel badly for the seller receiving one star reviews when he or she does not deserve them.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UAZGTE10FSUN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B075L3Q34T,Size: 4 Count (Pack of 1)

"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024",Cassidy White,yes,yes,Decent with some flaws,"I bought these chalk markers to use on my chalkboard calendar.  I had read the reviews and thought they would be a great buy.  Overall, they are decent chalk markers and have great colors.  The downside to these markers is that some of the more neon colors seem to be watery and do not deposit color like they should.  This is mainly the bright pink and bright orange.  The pastel colors work great and deposit color like they should.  I have tried a couple methods to clean them off my chalkboard calendar and have found that it takes a lot to remove them.  I used to just use water and it seemed that you could still see where I had previously written.  I have also tried using windex and dawn to gently remove and neither option showed any real improvement.  When it comes to cleaning, you will have to dedicate time and effort to fully remove past writings.  That being said, the color lasts and once it has dried the colors remain vibrant and easy to see.  These markers are easy to use and overall a good quality with only a few drawbacks.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R114XXNHJ6ACIU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B08JW8S231,Size: 1 Count (Pack of 16)
"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024",Dell K.,yes,yes,Great  chalk markers BUT......,"Loddie Doddie Liquid Chalk Markers are just what I needed for my monthly planner board. I was tired of the same 4 neon colors that I had to use over and over. But with these markers I can now create with every color of the rainbow and more. First, let's get the only CON out of the way... when first starting to use these, there are directions on the box to shake and tap for a few seconds to start the paint flow. Well, OMG! this made an absolute mess over and over with quite a lot of my pens. I kept trying to be gentle with each pen during the initial use. Keep paper towels handy! This made splatters and dime sized pools of paint come out. I cleaned all this up and after that ,the use of these pens were great.I love these pens! They are so easy to use. Clean up was a breeze with window cleaner. One swipe with a saturated paper towel and it was gone. You can saturate window cleaner on a microfiber cloth too, that also worked for me. When I got some on my hand I used simple soap and water on my hands to clean up easily. The colors are so wonderful. The photos of the metallic pen colors don't do true justice, they are amazing in person. I will repurchase these.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31WCOfs+-nL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41A5cwkxhzL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NNCGFUSXICL0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B08JW3NM26,Size: 1 Count (Pack of 24)
"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2022",Hannah,yes,yes,"For the most part gets the job done but is only ""okay"" quality....","Although these markers aren't nearly as expensive as some other brands of liquid chalk (thus why I bought these), I was not too impressed with the quality of them. Although they mostly do the job, having a bold look to most of the colors and a good selection of colors (including some metallic looking ones), the markers themselves are pretty unreliable. The tips are reversible (one rounded side and one more of a squared off line), BUT on the ones I have flipped to the squared off side, nearly all of the tips resulted in uneven, unfilled lines and I ended up switching back to the rounded. Additionally, some of my colors (especially the neon ones) are so clear/liquidy that the pigment won't even show up and/or stick to the painted chalk board. Quite a few of the colors are also too dark to show up if you are using dark gray or black chalk board/paint. Lastly, when priming many of the markers, it will go from absolutely no liquid coming out to just a sudden, huge flow of liquid dripping everywhere.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU2DJEOHXBE5Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B08JW3NM26,Size: 1 Count (Pack of 24)

"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2024",Disappointed customer,yes,yes,Some colors come out very watery after initial use,"Have a family calendar chalkboard that we purchased these with which to use.  The initial use, the colors were very bright and vibrant.  Each marker was primed correctly and worked great.  When used again, there were a few colors (orange, red, pink, and blue) that came out extremely watery even after shaking.  I reached out to the manufacturer and they suggested to rinse out the tip with warm water and try to prime once again.  The picture included is what that looks like after the 2nd attempt.  The orange and red are still watery and look like they are dripping to the bottom of where the color was used.  Almost like the words are crying.  We will continue to give them a shot as there are a few colors that haven't been used yet.Added additional picture today.

No amount of wiping or scrubbing has done anything to make the chalk shadows fade. The previous set I’d used by a different brand never left shadows as bad as this.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024",Amazon Customer,yes,yes,Disappointed  - they did not come off,"I recently purchased the Loddie Doddie Liquid Chalk Markers with high hopes of adding creative designs to my chalkboard paint surface. However, my experience with these markers was far from satisfactory, ultimately leading to frustration and disappointment.Despite the promising description of being ""perfect for chalkboards,"" these markers proved to be ill-suited for use on chalkboard paint. Upon application, I quickly noticed that the ink did not adhere well to the surface, resulting in uneven and patchy lines. Even after multiple layers, the colors appeared faded and lacked vibrancy, rendering my designs dull and unimpressive.To make matters worse, the so-called ""dust-free"" claim fell short of expectations. Instead of producing clean, crisp lines, the markers left behind a powdery residue that smudged easily, creating a mess that was difficult to clean up. Not only did this diminish the visual appeal of my designs, but it also made the surface look unkempt and unprofessional.In the end, my experience with the Loddie Doddie Liquid Chalk Markers was so disappointing that I had to resort to repainting my chalkboard surface entirely. Not only was this a waste of time and effort, but it also added an unexpected expense to my project.Overall, I cannot recommend these markers for use on chalkboard paint surfaces.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2021",Nikki,yes,yes,"Great concept, but needs work","So I thought it was a great idea that the tip of each marker is double sided so that you can switch it and have two tip options. However, I think because of this, the flow of the ink is very unpredictable. I followed the instructions and shook the markers before each use, then pressed down on the tip until the ink started to flow. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that you must shake the markers with the lid on because sometimes ink will fly everywhere. I also learned the hard way that if you press down too hard on the tip, it can get stuck, which is a huge mess. Another major problem I had is that sometimes, even when things seemed to be working ok, it would either suddenly put out way too much ink that would just puddle on my chalk board when I tried to write, or it would get kind of dry (even though I was writing with the tip pointing down) and I would have to press down on the tip again, which may or may not cause too much ink to come out again 🤦🏻‍♀️. I did give them two stars instead of one because all the colors are nice, and when they did work properly, they wrote really nicely. Unfortunately though, if I hadn’t procrastinated and missed the return window, I would definitely be returning them.",2,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PEVARD47CPK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JW3NM26,B08JW8S231,Size: 1 Count (Pack of 16)

They emailed me back in a couple of days, (I sent the email on the weekend, so I didn’t expect to hear back until the next business day) they thanked me for the purchase and wanted to fix the problem right away. I was surprised and delighted that they actually sent a new box and as a bonus several of their new pens. They are really nice for writing on my whiteboard calendar. I would definitely support this company and recommend them, not just because they mailed me extras, but because their customer service is to be commended! And their products are really nice.

It wasn’t vibrating more like a mini shadow left behind. I only used water to clean it up. But I’m sure if you use a Clorox wipe it will go away. I feel like I got my moneys well worth.

As the description mentioned, if you have a porous chalkboard it needs to be primed (pic 2). To do this, I used some broken random chalk I had at home and rubbed it anywhere I would use the markers. I wiped it off with a dry paper towel. Then I primed the markers on a blank sheet of paper. The green was fine but the purple, pink, and blue started leaking and dripping. I took another paper towel and wiped around the edge of the marker. After all the drips were cleared, we used them on the chalkboards and they worked perfectly!Moral of the story- do the prep work and have paper towel around. But, these are 100% worth the money.

However, these are incredibly difficult to wipe off. I didn’t realize the instructions on the box that says that you should prime the board before using these. If you do decide to go with these definitely prime the chalkboard (whatever that means) Otherwise you’ll probably have to use a stronger agent because a wet paper towel, a wet paper towel with Dawn, and vinegar did not work.

I always thought they were too pricey but since I got them during Prime Days & see how good they are, I won't mind paying the full price in the future.In my photos, the circlular cut is from a good board surface & the colors written in are on a cheap surface. It looks better on the good board but is still vibrant on the cheaper surface.PROS:They are so vibrant that they really stand out on the black background. Even the Blue and Purple which for some reason did not show up with the other sets I had.Even when the liquid is completely dry - like a day later - the colors are just as vibrant.They are easy to prime.

I’ll be looking for a different for future use.The colors are good once you get the marker primed well.

All of the colors worked, and they didn't spew ink everywhere. Some of the colors did have the issue where it was like they were dry. So it was hard to get them to write smoothly. I'd have to pump ink out and kinda spread it around with the marker rather than actually being able to write with it. This was after using them a few times so I don't know if ink may have dried on the tips causing them not to absorb and spread the inks. Other than that though they worked really well. The colors are really pretty and vibrant.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKQBPPSSSSKA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QF31BNY,B07QF31BNY,Color: Vibrant 6mm
"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2022",Caruby,yes,yes,Love these,"So I bought these to use at work.  I work in freight and sometimes we have to write on a piece of metal or hard plastic. I've used permanent markers & china markers (white hard wax pencils) but I find they are sometimes hard to see. I wanted something that the customer could easily wipe off once their freight arrived but was BRIGHT enough that my dockworkers could read the instructions on without having to squint or worry about lighting.  These do the trick. You can lick your finger and wipe it clean off. Just water removes it perfectly. And they stayed on one piece that got hit directly with rain and didn't look worse for wear. So if you're looking for something bright neon that has pow and stays in place until you want it gone, these are it.  They do tend to feather if you're writing on something pourous like untreated wood or a bubbly plastic, but on metal, concrete, and cardboard they are good. Cardboard you will need to write over it twice, but that's to be expected. I use these daily & have even had a few ""borrowed"" by coworkers who loved my idea to use these instead of a Sharpie. And they last for a good long time. Definitely plan to buy again once I run out of colors.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24L2LRX4YQQ1B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QF31BNY,B07QF31BNY,Color: Vibrant 6mm

They’re very fun to work with!Also I swatched the black on top of the dried white paint swatch since I have a black chalkboard. The formula doesn’t like that apparently though because it caused the black layer to bubble up and flake off.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023",Fred,yes,yes,Inconsistent,"This was the first set I bought and I quickly bought the second one based on one or two of the markers. However after using all of the colors, I realized that some of them either don't have enough ink in them or that there is a problem with the flow. For example the yellow in both sets is faint and doesn't jump out while the white is very bold and bright. Also the white and the other colors are opaque which means the background media color doesn't come through but the yellow seems to be like thin ink rather than pigmented liquid chalk and the background media color does come through and the liquid ""chalk"" is no longer yellow.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF1D182A71XF6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QF31BNY,B07QF31BNY,Color: Vibrant 6mm
"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025",JW,yes,yes,Bright and Fun Chalk Markers,"I recently tried these Chalk Markers and was quite impressed with their vibrant colors, ease of use, and versatility. Whether on glass, chalkboards, or other non-porous surfaces, they write smoothly and dry quickly, making them great for kids, businesses, or creative projects.Pros:✅ Brilliant Colors – The shades are bold, bright, and really stand out, making them perfect for menus, decorations, or DIY crafts.✅ Reversible Tips – The ability to switch between a fine point and a chisel tip adds flexibility, making it easy to write neatly or create artistic designs.✅ Erasable & Non-Toxic – The water-based formula wipes off easily from non-porous surfaces with a damp cloth, and it's safe for kids to use.✅ Good Value – For an 8-pack, the price is reasonable considering the quality and color vibrancy.Cons:❌ Not Always Erasable on Porous Surfaces – These markers work great on glass and chalkboards, but if used on porous materials (like some painted chalkboards), they may leave a stain. It's best to test on a small area first.❌ Priming Takes a Bit of Effort – Before first use, you need to shake and press the tip down several times to get the ink flowing, which can be slightly tedious.❌ Ink Flow Can Be Inconsistent – While generally smooth, some markers may release excess ink or require extra shaking to maintain even flow.Final Verdict:Overall, these chalk markers are a fantastic option for vibrant, temporary designs on the right surfaces. While they have some minor drawbacks, such as priming time and potential staining, they are still a great choice for businesses, artists, and families looking for colorful, erasable markers.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDVNJ0U7J60PX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QF31BNY,B07QF31BNY,Color: Vibrant 6mm

"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019",Jassmin,yes,yes,It ruined my blackboard,"When I bought these markers, I was excited to use them for my blackboard. I seen many great reviews about the color vibrancy and the longevity of the markers. When they finally arrived, I immediately put them to use. I was first amazed on the brightness of each of the colors. I tested them out in a section of my own board and came out nice and, at first, cleaning it wasn’t a problem based on their video instructions. I continued using my board as one of my ways to communicate my partner on my work schedule and who fed our dog since we have completely opposite working schedules. A week has passed by and it was time to change the dates and comments that I previously wrote on the broad that week. I followed the cleaning process that THEY PROVIDED for the blackboards. First, it was extremely difficult to clean compared to the first time that I used the markers and cleaned it with the fresh ink. I had to sit and thoroughly clean the board in the same spot over and over again, but it never looked 100% clean because it literally left a cast that if you see it at an angle, you can clearly tell what I wrote. Secondly, it took away the black chalkboard paint off my board. At first I thought it was my own fault but I realized that I applied the same amount of pressure everywhere on my board, and only specific colors were taking the chalk paint of the board away. I had this board for well over a year and used so many other products and never had an issue up until this point, so the fact that it LITERALLY RUINED MY OWN PRODUCT was very upsetting. In summary, it might be good for short time uses or items that you know you won’t use/erase again, but not for using it on a weekly basis.

What I love most about these is their brilliant color pop!  I’ve had some brands that dripped down my board and we’re hard to see the writing.  That was frustrating.  All the more reason I already love these.  I did read some reviews complaining they couldn’t remove the chalk.  I have chalk remover that worked just fine.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024",Arlin,yes,yes,Works well and tips are good,"Works well on my black dry erase boards, the colors stand out very well, very bright, very demure. The tips are fine enough to make small writing, but thick enough to make writing that takes up a lot of space, very mindful.I just don’t like that the ink sometimes gets stuck in the tips on the markers and dries up which makes it a little troublesome the next time I use them.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",Barbara,yes,yes,Mostly a Successful Purchase!,"The markers that do work, work wonderfully! The colors are vibrant and very saturated; they dry in a couple minutes and wipe off my board super easily with water (read the instructions tho)! With one exception: there’s something wrong with the middle orange marker in the pic of all the flowers (don’t ask me why I ended up drawing crummy flowers to swatch these). It must have been a dud, it’s almost like its too watery and doesn’t have enough pigment making it look brown instead of vibrant orange. Otherwise the rest of these markers write beautifully so far!! They’re very fun to work with!Also I swatched the black on top of the dried white paint swatch since I have a black chalkboard. The formula doesn’t like that apparently though because it caused the black layer to bubble up and flake off. I’m not sure if that’s usual/common with chalk markers or not, this is my first time with this medium.My only wish for these markers is for them to be labeled or numbered so they’re easier to differentiate since some of the colors are close to each other, but that’s my personal preference.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NTPs1Jo5L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qdagkuSaL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mbDGVRnIL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12S9Q8B53O1YM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07Q4K1HRJ,B086TYM8W9,Style: 6mm - 20 Pack
"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022",Amazon Customer,yes,yes,Updated review..... fantastic customer service,"These markers and challenge you to make smooth lines but it's the nature of the product not a flaw by the manufacturer.  I was refreshing a movie marquee and, in the picture shown, the yellow was an overlay of the existing pattern.  The dotting was a function of a previous marker (and different marker style) but the reason I gave only 3 stars was because I didn't even have enough ink to completely cover the old sign markings.  You can see that I ran out without finishing and thoroughly covering the yellow circle surrounding the ""Cat Ballou"" movie title.  Otherwise, these are a good product with sharp color which arrived quickly after I placed the order.Wow!

Most worked perfectly, but some of them pool up and make what you’re writing look weird.

All of them eventually dry well enough that it doesn’t smudge, and they all wipe away fairly easily. I’m very happy with how bright all of the colors are. There are two tip options if you pull the tip out and turn it around. I would think that is a messy process once they’re full of ink. I left mine on the regular marker tip. It writes a bit thick, but it’s still small enough to write in the small boxes. I’m happy enough with these markers. I may try another brand in the future just because of the way some colors do that weird pooling thing while others don’t. Like too much ink is coming out at once.

I also have chalkboard tape I use the chalkboard pens with for the same purpose. The pens I used in the past were perfect for the job. Ordered these, and they've been a real pain. The color gets on everything it touches. The ""ink"" never stabilizes the way that other chalkboard pens I used did - it's as if it remains actively wet forever, and when I move jars around in my fridge, I find it on my hands afterward; I've found it on food I've taken out of my containers that somehow bumped something the ""ink"" had gotten on. Also, the tip on these pens is rounded in a way the other pens I used were not, so it's hard to get a nice fine edge for good-looking writing. Less control in the shape of the letters because of the way the pen tip is shaped.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REZ38P6PUTPS4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07Q4K1HRJ,B07Q4K1HRJ,Style: 6mm - 8 Pack

It takes several shakes & pressing, and I can't do it on a paper towel because that exacerbates the dryness.

The picture makes them look better than they actually do. I can't see the purple at all, and can hardly see the other colors. This set is so incredibly different! True neon colors, way easier to write and see. It didn't take me long at all to shake/ press, shake/ press. Some of the ink did flow very fast, so be sure to have a paper towel or 2 folded up. I kind of rolled the side/ edge of the marker if I felt like there was way too much ink on there, so it wouldn't run.

I tested them out on the little chalkboard tags that came with the markers. Definitely beautiful and easy to use. Just follow the directions and the markers work. I had to hold the tip down for 10 seconds for some of the markers and others it took less time. Make sure the tip is filled with the color before writing/drawing for best results. I am pleased with the product.I am giving 4 stars because when I opened the Amazon package, the product’s box was open. You can see that it was ripped On top (probably didn’t see the clear tap on the package) and then opened on the bottom of the packaging. I have no idea if it’s because of the transport to get to me or if someone had opened it before shipping it to me. I do know with the COVID that they are taking special precautions with everything that is sent to the US. I just found it odd and uncomfortable. But the products work and they seem full so I have no other complaints! Can’t wait to use them in future projects 🙂I also want to mention that I have to wet a cloth and rub to get this to remove from the chalkboard.

Reason is because the color might come splattering from around the top. Not too much, not gushing, but just little drops or splats.

It would leave traces of the the fibers along side of the actual line I just made. 3 some of them ran out very quickly. For instance I used the black to make 6 50 cent piece size circles and I struggled to get them completely colored in.What I liked about them was they included metallic colors. Of all the chalk markers I own these are at the bottom of my list. Maybe I got a bad box or something but I know I won't reorder these again.,3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KB9R4Q6QEV78/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QZW54NP,B07QZW54NP,Size: Bold Tip - 6mm
"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020",Liza,yes,yes,"So much fun, wish they were refillable!","Last semester I took a children's art/creativity class (I work with young children) and we were encouraged to design art experiences for young children that allow them to explore as many different materials as possible, rather than focusing on the work they create.  ""Process not product.""I'd never tried chalk markers before and I thought they would be fun (even for me) as I like the looks of them when I see the results on ""chalkboards"" outside of restaurants.These are great.  I tried them on a plastic surface (a binder with the clear plastic on top) and was able to erase my work afterwards.  And they inspired me to ""draw"" (it's more like paint) on my front window.To whomever said that they take a long time to become usable, mine were fine but I read the directions!  You have to push the tip down a few times in order to get the ink flowing.  Also, shake before use.  I had no problems.I docked one star because I feel kind of guilty using them.  Yes, they are non-toxic with environmentally friendly ink, but I would LOVE if you could refill the ink via the top because it's kind of a big pen to just dump in the landfill when the ink runs out.  Also, I'd love if there was some kind of assurance that the laborers who made these were treated fairly since these were made in China, fair trade certification or something.But as far as do I enjoy owning a set of chalk markers and do these work?  Yes.P.S.  I feel these are a little heavy for preschool children but would be great for older children (1'st grade and above) and I would have loved to see what my high school students would have done with them <3",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18GD545WS38K5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QZW54NP,B07QZW54NP,Size: Bold Tip - 6mm

They are so vibrant, with so many different colors, and very easy to erase using a wet cloth. I’ve only used them on a blackboard, but they color it well and come off completely from my board. It takes minor effort to get the liquid flowing through the markers—just a few shakes and pushing the tip repeatedly until the liquid makes it to the tip. This was the first time I used metallic colors, and they are beautiful. They seem to have a bit of a glittery look. Love these colors; there are so many, and they are pretty affordable.

The tips are definitely ""mushy"" to begin with and priming markers is sort of brutal on the tips anyway, so this one broke down very quickly.I'm planning to use the markers on the bullet side, so the loss of the chisel side of the tip wasn't a deal-breaker, but I would recommend priming the marker on the opposite end of the tip you plan on using, just to save the tips you WILL be using.I'm going to update my review if the tips don't hold up to regular use. For now they are working okay- I just wish the tips of the markers were a higher quality, but aat the price I paid for this collection of markers, I can't expect the most durable nibs in the world.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV44SNZGLWAN0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QZW54NP,B07QZW54NP,Size: Bold Tip - 6mm

They are my favourite for writing I use thin tipped markers for drawing and doodling but ideally, if I’m going to write on anything as long as the space is big enough, I use this set on the broad tip and they are my favorite. In the picture above it is what was used for January .Small disclaimer- I have found that chalk markers do not like to be used on absorbent surfaces. Do not use them on paper or cardboard as it will decrease the longevity of the markers. When you’re going to do a test mark to see if it’s the colour you like, do it on the floor or a hard surface that you can wipe off of.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",Mason,yes,yes,Easy to clean off true chalkboard material,"I liked the variety of colors for the price. I liked that there were two tips to the markers as well. They took a little bit to shake and get going but that’s to be expected. I was the most worried about how easy they were going to be to clean off since I did not want to lose use of my chalkboard. I cleaned it off with an envirocloth from Norwex and it came off easily and quickly and it had been on the chalkboard for about 24 hours. I also used them on a cheap mini “chalkboard” sign that was essentially paper stuck to some plastic and it did not come off it easily. They were from the dollar store so I threw it away and it wasn’t a big deal. Moral of the story, the markers worked well and wiped off easily for me from a true chalkboard but not from a cheap wannabe chalkboard.",4,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kvNIfSVpL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3693LYG2BKVHO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0846W6TN8,B0846W6TN8,Size: Bold Tip - 6mm

I even reversed them but didn't help. I haven't used them enough yet to see how they hold up over time, or if they improve with use. I also don't yet know if they're going to leak - although the very neon ones - pink green & yellow - are much runnier/juicy on the tips, and not as opaque as expected. i have no complaints about performance about the 2 metallic pens, so far they're working the best. the only negative about the gold in particular is its very hard to clean off the board. we have a glass LED lighted sign. most of the markers dry erase pretty easily, except the bright neons smear when dry erased & need wet washed sometimes several times. the metallic gold needs ALOT of elbow grease to dry erase & SEVERAL wet WIPES to completely clean the glass.

One was missing.,Liked the idea of it and like them overall: orange isn’t as strong as some of the other colours which you can kind of see in the photo.

Also the gold one was missing from the package. It only had the nine pictured.

Its when you go to write, nothing comes out of the tip. I've defined my muscles with how long I've tried to get these things to write. I've tried every trick in the book trying to get them to work.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2021",Amazon Customer,yes,yes,"Okay Markers, Have Some Problems. Long Review but Read Carefully Before Buying","These markers are a good value and came in nice colors, but I had several problems with them. I am optimistically giving it 3 stars but my view could change if more problems arise, since there are already quite a few. The problems:1. two of the markers came funky, they weren't right and the ink was really thin, not opaque. the tips were already partially colored when I opened them, before they were primed, so I'm assuming whatever compounds start in them that you are supposed to shake up had already leaked into the tip before being mixed, and now the marker will never be right. (I was still able to use one since the level of translucence gave me highlights and lowlights, making it useful for certain types of art)2. the very tips of the chisel tip end don't seem to allow ink out. to try and get a fine line you have to try and write on the side of the tip, and the ink won't always come out properly. The flat part of the chisel works fine.3. I bought the 3mm fine tip, as I had one fine tip marker already from somewhere else, and thought it would be the right size- wrong! Either the marker I had before ran small or (likely) these run a little big. Not for fine lines, or fine writing, especially with the chisel tip problem4. My favorite color was perfect in my initial test, where I made a single mark to see how it would look, but when I went to use it for real, no ink would come out! I tried and tried, because I could see ink flowing into the sides of the tip, just not the end. I tried shaking it, pressing it, pumping it, even setting it upside-down (p.s. don't do that ink will be everywhere) and nothing would come out when I went to actually use it, despite flowing out when I pumped or turned it upsidedown. I turned the tip around to chisel thinking maybe that would work. it did for about a day, but now that ink is no longer flowing through (because the tip in the marker won't allow ink through) and the ink previously in the chisel tip has gone dry, it will not make a mark. the marker is useless, which is sad.5. the lighter colors are a bit more sheer than I would have liked. I wish they were a little more opaque when dried, so I didn't have to go over the lines again and again.So yeah. I probably should have given them 2 stars instead of 3 but I really liked the array of colors and the price, and the ones that did work made nice art. Not so good for writing fine but whatever I'll find a finer tip chalk marker for that.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HCARXB4XSBZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B089NN5R7Y,B07XXSGX21,Style: Fine Tip - 3mm

"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 29, 2019",Dave,yes,yes,Great value and selection of colours,My wife gets through a lot of coloured markers in her job as a trainer. This Chalkola box contains 30 chalk pens for writing on pretty much any surface. On non-absorbent surfaces such as blackboards and whiteboards the ink is removeable with a damp cloth. On paper and card the ink is permanent making these pens highly versatile. They even write on glass as you can see from the attached photo.The pens are activated by pressing on the nib to start the ink flow. This is a great feature as you can easily restart the ink flow should they dry up a little. The colours are rich and varied and the ink when dry feels just like chalk. 30 pens for £20 is an absolute steal and the selection of colours is fabulous.,5,-,-,-,B07MP1T5SG,Style: Bold Tip - 6mm

They are stunningly vibrant and like nothing I had used before! My son even tried them on his face and he when I took a picture, it looked like I had used an on screen drawing tool! They are a thick liquid and will bleed through normal paper, so it is better to use heavy cardstock, glossy paper or posterboard. We had the most fun using it for posterboard. Just be sure to give it enough time to dry if you used thicker sections of color, and do NOT out your hands through it until then either or you will have a mess on you, the project, and your crying child....

The colors are brilliant and this provides great coverage. I paint my chalkboards with this liquid marker. By simply using an old piece of cardboard I press down gently on the tip of the marker allowing the chalk to make a paint palate.  I then use either a sponge or a paintbrush depending on the look I want to achieve. Please see clouds versus sunflowers versus solid fill.  The tips of these markers are also fine enough to write with, please see scripture passage. The chalk dries quickly so you need to do just a small amount at a time. I TYPICALLY do a new design every month,  So far these chalkboard markers have created 3 full designs and there is still plenty of chalkboard paint in them.  This chalkboard faces due South in the state of Florida so after about 3 weeks the colors begin fading. This chalkboard is protected from direct water source however it is subject to high humidity.

"Reviewed in Spain on December 26, 2020",Venus y Marte💙💚💝,-,yes,"Perfectos para crear pequeñas obras de arte, o simplemente apuntar cosas en la pizarra.","Me han gustado mucho estos rotuladores de tiza líquida. Normalmente los uso para escribir en una pizarra grande que tengo en la cocina, para hacer la lista de la compra, las tareas pendientes y para que dibujen mis hijos de 2 y 4 años. A veces también los usamos para pintar los cristales de la casa y decorar el salón o el cuarto, y son perfectas para la pizarra reversible de los niños, tanto para la parte blanca, como para la parte negra.Prefiero usar este tipo de rotuladores porque no ensucian tanto como las tizas normales, que lo dejan todo lleno de polvo. Además los colores son más vivos y más definidos, y los dibujos quedan muchísimo mejor.La caja incluye 30 rotuladores de tiza de punta reversible (redonda y plana).Además incluye 50 etiquetas adhesivas negras para pegar donde queramos y escribirlas o dibujar con los rotuladores. En nuestro caso las usamos para los botes de cristal de la cocina, y le da un toque original y muy vintage.Para que el rotulador se recargue, como indico en el vídeo, hay que agitar antes y en vertical presionar varias veces la punta había abajo, y veremos cómo la tinta va hacia la punta, permitiendo así la escrituraEl color es borrable siempre y cuando pintemos sobre una superficie no porosa, es decir, una pizarra, cristal, cerámica, azulejos, etc... Si por el contrario lo hacemos sobre una superficie porosa, pueden quedar restos a la hora de intentar eliminarlo (madera, cartón, papel, tela,..).Por ponerle una pega, es un poco sucio darle la vuelta a la punta, ya que lo tienes que hacer con los dedos.La relación calidad precio me parece estupenda comparada con otros productos similares.El precio podría ser menor, pero sale a poco menos de un euro cada rotulador tomando como referencia el precio actual, en mi opinión bastante económico si le vas a dar buen uso.El paquete llegó en la fecha estimada sin incidencias.Espero haberte sido útil!",5,-,-,-,B089NN5R7Y,Style: Extra Fine Tip - 1mm

A bit annoying when the paint drips or when you try to colour in bits where theres marker nearby as it just erases bits you've done already or smudges with other colours and becomes a muddy mess, so make sure you have Q-tips and kitchen roll to hand and make sure your paint has dried before erasing or colouring near it as it WILL smudge everywhere. Definitely did the job though! Coloura are good and bright.Update: Easy to clean, just wipes off! I used a dry eraser. It does flake, so if you can open the window when erasing I advise that you do.

They don't show up as well as I wanted, which is sort of like chalks on a blackboard.  Quite often they pool.

La punta es fina (de 1 milímetro) por lo que para dibujos con mucho detalle o trabajos de precisión son perfectos.Pintan muy bien y los colores son bonitos, especialmente si pintas sobre negro ya que resaltan muchísimo más. Se pueden utilizar sobre superficies no porosas como vidrio o pizarra y después se puede borrar sin que quede la marca. En la caja además de los 30 rotuladores viene un paquete con etiquetas adhesivas de color negro, estupendas para poner los nombres de una forma bonita en los regalos de navidad.En general están bien, hay muchísimos colores y muy variados, pintan bien y el precio es bastante asequible si los comparamos con los POSCA que es lo más similar que creo que hay en el mercado, aunque obviamente tampoco es la misma calidad.
